This is a desktop voice assistant which can help u to search anything on Wikipedia , open google , open other custom application , youtube , play music , send emails , wish you on your birthday, set a timer and many more. You can help us to upgrade it.



***If the voice is not being recognized by the computer/the built AI , then you have to import PyAudio .
In the terminal paste this command - pip install PyAudio.
